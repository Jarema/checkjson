Check that a JSON object's keys correspond to a struct's exported members or JSON tags.

ANNOUNCEMENTS

2017.02.13 - Handle "-" and "omitempty" JSON tags in struct definitions.
2017.02.08 - UnknownJSONKeys lists all JSON object keys that won't be decoded. 
2016.11.18 - MissingJSONKeys lists all struct members that won't be set by JSON object.

USAGE

MOTIVATION

I make extensive use of JSON configuration files.  Sometimes the files are large or
complex and JSON keys can be prone to typos or case errors. The "encoding/json" decoder 
just ignores JSON keys that do not correspond to struct member names/tags; this can 
result in unexpected initialization errors or the failure to override defaults. 
The checkjson.Validate() function identifies JSON object keys that cannot be decoded 
to a member of the struct using the "encoding/json" package.
